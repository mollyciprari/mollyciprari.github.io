		<p> Hi, I am Molly Ciprari. I grew up in Manhattan Beach, California and have always been someone who loved traveling to the city of Santa Monica in my free time; therefore I thought it was the perfect place for the first ever Crave Vegan Cafe. In 2016, I discovered that I was severly lactose intolerant and I could no longer eat any type of dairy. This transition was very hard for me because I loved yogurt and ice cream, but luckily I was able to find delicious alternatives. After about a year of cutting dairy out of my life, I decided I wanted to try a vegan diet; it was the best decision I have ever made. I found a passion for creating plant based meals and decided I wanted to share all my meals and ideas for planet based food combinations with everyone which led to the opening to Crave Vegan Cafe. My goal for CVC is to allow people from all over to experience amazing and clean vegan meals and allow them to fall in love with plant based foods! </p>
